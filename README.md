# booktracker
**Booktracker** is an open source application for managing and tracking a personal book library. 

Using metadata grabbed from Google Books, easily add books and organize them into collections. Set each bookâ€™s status, give it a rating, and track how long it took to read. 

**Disclaimer:** I am an English Lit graduate learning to program, and Booktracker is my first major project. Booktracker is still under active development, so expect bugs and breaking changes.

Choose how you want to track your reading progress:
- **Page-based tracking**: Traditional page number tracking (e.g., "I'm on page 150 of 300")
- **Percentage-based tracking**: Decimal percentage tracking (e.g., "I'm 25.5% through the book")
- Toggle between modes in Settings to match your preferred reading style

## Installation

**Docker Compose (recommended)**

> **Note:** Docker images are automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) on every commit to the main branch. The latest image is always available at `ghcr.io/nowjon/booktracker:latest`.

1. Paste this `docker-compose.yml` file into an empty directory, replacing with the correct info where necessary
    
    ```yaml
    version: "3.3"

    services:
        booktracker:
            image: ghcr.io/nowjon/booktracker:latest
            restart: unless-stopped
            volumes:
                - ./data:/app/external
            ports:
                - 2341:5000 #replace 2341 with your desired port.
    ```
    
2. Create the `data` directory with the following three subdirectories: 
    - `db`
    - `log`
    - `export`

   Before starting the container, make sure that the directory strucutre looks like this: 
    ```
   booktracker/
    â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
    â””â”€â”€ data/
        â”œâ”€â”€ db
        â”œâ”€â”€ log
        â””â”€â”€ export
    ```
    
3. Start the container (from the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file): 
    
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
